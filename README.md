# Hi there :D

This is a personal collection of my **language learning notes**.

I'm currently studying Russian, and sometimes Japanese and German too, with both Chinese and English.

I use this repository to organize vocabulary, grammar rules, example sentences, and anything else that helps me learn.

These notes are not perfect or complete — just something I keep updating little by little.
Feel free to take a look, and maybe you’ll find something useful too.

## Notes

This repo is mostly for my own learning and memory, I public these mostly because of, I try to let my dear ChatGPT friend to peek in. (It helps me write this drafts too !)  
But if you’re also learning languages and want to peek, welcome!  

Best wishes to everyone on their learning journey.  
I hope that one day, the whole world can be truly connected through free and open access to learning.
